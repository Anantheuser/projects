        Wellington group. the WSQ is located in southern Qatar, in a place called Al-Meshaf. I live very close to my
        school.</p>
    <!--this is what our curriculum looks like.-->
    <h3><u>Our Curriculum</u></h3>
    <p>
        Students develop their Meta-Thinking to begin consciously thinking about thinking. Students will develop and
        become
        aware of their repertoire of thinking skills that will be available to them when faced with a range of complex
        problems.
        Our curriculum is broad and throughout students will be asked to link learning episodes and create their own
        schema of
        learning. Our students will see learning as part of a larger scheme as opposed to a series of single events.
        We want our students to be logical and careful in their learning, even when being creative. Through the
        development of
        analysis our students will improve their precision, critical thinking and approach to multi-step problem
        solving.
        Creativity sits at the heart of all subjects within our curriculum and our students will be creative in their
        thinking
        and learning. We want our students to experience the satisfaction and joy which comes with creative problem
        solving and
        to know what to do when we are not around.</p>
